### Abstract: 
Mode collapse is a well-known issue with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and is a byproduct of unstable GAN training. We propose to improve the sample diversity of a pre-trained class-conditional generator by modifying its class embeddings in the direction of maximizing the log probability outputs of a classifier pre-trained on the same dataset. We improved the sample diversity of state-of-the-art ImageNet BigGANs at both 128 x 128 and 256 x 256 resolutions. By replacing the embeddings, we can also synthesize plausible images for Places365 using a BigGAN pre-trained on ImageNet.
